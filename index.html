    <p class="margin">According to Vivid Seats in this <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/vivid-seats-more-49ers-fans-will-be-at-nfc-championship-game-than-week-18/2793978/" target="_blank">article by NBC</a>, Sofi stadium will be filled 65% by 49ers fans. <i title="played in the Rams Home stadium" >note that the 49ers are playing away, this is not a home game.</i> this is a very similar sernario to what happened <span class="note">week 18</span> when the 49ers were fighting for a playoff berth. The 49ers trailed by <b>17 points</b> at one point in the game & cameback to win 27-24 in overtime.</p>

    <h2 class="margin">NFC West</h2>
    <p class="margin">It is no surprise that another NFC West team will represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. Arguably the <em>toughest</em> division in football right now. 3 NFC teams (49ers, Rams, Cardinals) made the post season, now 2 NFC West teams will battle it out for the NFC Title. Here's a look at the 2021 NFC West standings.</p>

<table class="margin" style="width:10%">
  <tr>
    <th>Team</th>
    <th>W/L</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rams</td>
    <td>12-5</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Cardinals</td>
    <td>11-6</td>

  <tr>
    <td>49ers</td>
    <td>10-7</td>

    <h2 class="margin">Keys to Victory</h2>
    <p class="margin"> This time around, the 49ers must not start slow like in the week 18 game, they must get to a hot start and control the game. The Rams are coming off 2 impressive Playoff wins, same with the 49ers. Both teams are <b>hot</b>. Here's what the 49ers must do to <b style="color:green;">stay alive once again</b> and go back to the Super Bowl</p>

<ul class="margin">
  <li>Control the Line of Scrimmage</li>
  <li>Run the ball 30+ times</li>
  <li>Get to Stafford with only the front 4</li>
  <li>Be physical</li>
</ul>

<img class="center" src="images/deeob.jpg" height="300" alt="Deebo Samuel must be involved once more against the rams">
    <h3 class="margin">Superbowl 56</h3>
    <p class="margin">The 49ers will play either the <b>Bengals or Chiefs</b> in the Super Bowl if they win today. If it's against the Chiefs, it'll be a rematch of Super Bowl 54 when the 49ers lost to the Chiefs 31-20 after being up 20-10 entering the 4th quarter. <a href="sbpreview.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to check out our Super Bowl Preview.</p>
