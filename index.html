    <h2>Good as Gould!</h2>
    <p> as the 49ers offense continues to struggle, only putting 3 points up in the 2nd half, the 49ers needed something to go their way in order to win the game. with 5 minutes left, Packers up 7, the 49ers block their punt and return it for a touchdown!. the score is now 10-10 late in the 4th. the next Packers drive the 49ers defense stall it and forces them to punt it away. with 3 minutes remaining, the 49ers have a shot at punching their ticket to the NFC Championship game. The 49ers offense moves down field & sets up Robbie Gould to kick the <b>game winning field goal</b>. from 45 yards out, Gould nails the field goal and the 49ers <b style="color:green;">stay alive</b> in the post-season!</p>

    <h3>Onto the Next</h3>
    <p> the 49ers will play either the <b>Rams or Buccaneers</b> in the NFC Championship
